Ruby programs to help you cheat at Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

I really like the game [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/).  I'm also a computer programmer.  We don't solve problems by consulting some silly Bomb Defusal Manual; we make computers do it for us.

Of course, using this totally defeats the purpose of playing the game.  You shouldn't actually use these tools, and you *should* play the game.

When this code is completed, I intend for it to have the ability to solve all of the puzzles in the game.  (Right now it has nothing.)  Again, this should not be used for actual game purposes; I just thought they'd be fun to code.  I condone building tools to cheat, but not the actual cheating.

Though I will point out that while the instructions of the game specifically forbid the person actually "solving" the bomb from consulting the Bomb Defusal Manual, it says nothing about downloading ruby repos and using the stored tools.  So it's only cheating in spirit, not so much in reality.

If loopholes help soothe your conscience, then there you go.
